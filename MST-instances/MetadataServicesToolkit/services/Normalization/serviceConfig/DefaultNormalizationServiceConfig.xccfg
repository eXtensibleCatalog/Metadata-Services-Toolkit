#*****************************************
# This section maps ILS location codes with the location limit name.

# If a location code has multiple limit names then they should be separated by |
# For example, The line "ArtMuscOS = Art/Music Library | Rush Rhees Library" says that the location limit names
# are "Art/Music Library" & "Rush Rhees Library" for location code is "ArtCage". 
#
# This is voyager specific. Any of the mappings may be changed based 
# on your organization's cataloging policies.  New properties may be
